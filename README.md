This repository contains machine learning projects demonstrating the use of various algorithms and data handling techniques. Each project is structured to show the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

## Projects Included

## 1. Diabetes Prediction

Objective: Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

Dataset: Sourced from an open dataset (attached in the project folder as diabetes.csv).

Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, logistic regression, support vector machine, accuracy metrics, etc.


## 2. House Price Prediction

Objective: Predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, etc.

Dataset: Loaded directly from sklearn.datasets (california Housing dataset).

Techniques Used: Linear regression, feature scaling, evaluation metrics like RMSE and RÂ².


## 3. Movie Recommendation System

Objective: Recommend movies to users based on collaborative filtering techniques.

Dataset: Movie ratings dataset (attached in the project folder as movies.csv).

Techniques Used: Cosine similarity, pivot tables, content-based and user-based filtering.


## Dataset Availability

Diabetes Prediction: Dataset included in the diabetes-prediction folder.

House Price Prediction: Dataset used from sklearn, no external file needed.

Movie Recommendation System: Dataset included in the movie-recommendation folder.
